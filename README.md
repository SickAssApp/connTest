# connTest
The main quest for this code is to find the best connection speed in a series of server.

Start with the php code at the begin of index.php, at this point I will give a series of URL and store them in a array before converting the array into JSON format string. After that, pass the string to an variable in Javascript then convert it into JSON object(Or you create the JSON obejct in Javascript).
